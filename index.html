                                    I grew up in the east of England and went to school in Norwich. I moved to Bristol in 1984 as a teenager. I have been a woodworker since 1988 and have worked for many clients in many different situations.
                                    In 1993 I started programming with a City & Guilds in COBOL and BASIC. During the nineties and noughties I became very familiar with music programming software and spent decades making music. Over the
                                    past few years I have been studying web development and its associated programming languages. Since I was 12 I have been keen on astronomy and have discovered 35 supernovae. I have also been involved with
                                    citizen science and have been writing for Wikipedia since 2006.

                                        <p>At the moment (September 2024) I am looking for a cyber security interview having gained the qualification "Level 3 Cyber Security Technician" with the Skills Network. I am also waiting for a CompTIA IT Fundamentals voucher from SN to take that exam. As part of the Skills Network course, I made a website for my groups' presentation called 'Cyber Enforcers' which is linked to on the Skills page.

                                            During 2022 - 2023 I was on the Code Institute Level 5 Web Development Full Stack course. Through this course, I have learnt about using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and PostgreSQL and built 4
                                            websites of increasing complexity. I like building websites! During 4 decades of employment I have worked as an English teacher, a sound stage contractor, a music producer and in many types of woodworking.

                                            I have gained vocational qualifications over the years in computing, teaching and woodwork. I have set up businesses and been awarded grants for doing so. Through familiarity with computers, I was
                                            able to get a foothold in the music business which lead to me building sound studios. After becoming tired of that business, I qualified as an English language teacher. I have a wealth of
                                            experience and have worked for many different types of customers.

                                            I am keen to be involved with AI and also realise that working with low code platforms such as Microsoft PowerApps and Mendix IDE is the way forward for coding and web development. Through
                                            interaction with people in the industry, I have developed a knowledge of where the trends over the next few years will be and am able to take on these challenges.
